# 💖 The Cupid's Love Calculator 💘

Welcome to the Love Calculator, where Cupid’s arrows meet technology to bring you an enchanting and playful way to check your relationship compatibility. This web-based tool is designed to be a fun, interactive experience where you can calculate the love percentage between you and your partner based on your names. But that’s not all—because self-love is important too! 💕 If you enter your own name in both fields, you'll unlock a special "Self-Love Percentage" that reminds you how awesome you are! 😎✨

Enter names: Type in your name and your partner’s name (or just your name, if you're feeling extra self-loving).
Press Calculate: Hit the magic button and watch as Cupid’s algorithm works its charm to calculate your love compatibility.
